# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who (hopefully) has already crossed the **Valley of Despair** in the Dunning-Kruger effect journey. With a solid foundation built through studies and professional experience, I've come to realize just how vast the field of tech is. No matter the challenge, I'm committed to continuous learning and pushing forward with enthusiasm and resilience.

In addition to my software interests, Iâ€™m also deeply into hardware, including computers, smartphones, accessories, and the latest gadgets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- In 2024, I made significant improvements in my spoken English, which had been a challenge. This opened up new opportunities for me. However, there is still much work to be done to reach the level I aspire to.
- In my free time, Iâ€™m developing a mod for the game *Guilty Gear XX Reload*, which aims to refresh and enhance an existing flawed online mode. The task is challenging due to the original code's comments and README being written in Japanese. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/guilty-gear-xx-reload).
- I plan to learn Kotlin to become more flexible within the JVM stack.
